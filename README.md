# SimpleEncryptionTool
This is a simple encryption tool I wrote in about 1 hour 45 minutes, still learning about using encryption okay :(.

- I reccommend testing on a folder you don't care about much before using it properly (if you do of course).

# How To Telegram Bot
- Set up a telegram bot, for example - bot father, once set up, copy the token that is given to you.
- Get your chat ID, personally I use @my_id_bot
- keep those with you until you've put them into the console (they aren't stored anywhere else, you can read the source code if you want).

If you want you can make updates, it helps for me to learn with :)
